# String_Processing
A simple string processing program that analyses strings and returns info and sorts them.
This is a project I worked on while going through competitive programming books!
There are some various things that you can do to test strings in this case, 
do note: 
- The termination condition is "......." (seven dots), otherwise, it will read the entire string
